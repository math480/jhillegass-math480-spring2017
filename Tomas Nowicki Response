Tomasz Nowicki spoke with us on Monday, January 23 about his career and the ways Mathematics has been used in that career. 
His presentation was in the style of chalk-and-board which I prefer over Powerpoint because you can easily fix mistakes and add 
information that you may have forgotten. If I knew exactly what was going on in the presentation, I would say that Mr. Nowicki 
was "effective" and "successful", but the topic was somewhat of a new field for me so I couldn't follow everything that was talked
about.

However, I was able to follow some of the topic and I enjoyed learning about how computer chips were made and how problems in that 
process could lead to needed help from a Mathematician. The presentation itself gave me insight on how math is used in different 
career settings and that is valuable information to me.
